Here, I collected tweets from the Twitter API to analyze the words people use when they
interact publicly on Twitter. I used a combination of techniques to complete this project, 
including text mining, sentiment analysis, statistical inference, and data visualization. 
This is an *in progress* report which I am working to finish shortly. Please view my 
[RPubs document](http://rpubs.com/kafay/politics-of-cyberbullying) for the most recent 
draft.
