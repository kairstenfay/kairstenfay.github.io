# Success!

After a year of labor and another year of being stuck in revisions land, I'm excited to say that
our publication from the Trudy MacKay lab was finally approved! Check out [this link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10519-016-9819-x)
to read the article in Behavior Genetics 2016, "Genetic and Genomic Response to Selection
for Food Consumption in *Drosophila melanogaster*".

If you're interested, read more medical writing work by the first author, [Dr. Megan Garlapow.](https://megangarlapow.com/home/writing_samples/)
