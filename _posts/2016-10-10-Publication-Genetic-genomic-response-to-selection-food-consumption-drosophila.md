# Success!

After a year of labor and another year of being stuck in revisions land, I'm excited to say that 
our publication from the Trudy MacKay lab was finally approved! Check out [this link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10519-016-9819-x)
to read the article in Behavior Genetics 2016, "Genetic and Genomic Response to Selection 
for Food Consumption in *Drosophila melanogaster*".
