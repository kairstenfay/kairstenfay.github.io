Here, I give a walkthrough of my submission to [Kaggle's](http://www.kaggle.com) famous 
[Titanic Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

The audience for this project was my fellow classmates. This project was meant to be 
extremely thorough and 100% reproducible. In a business setting, I would exclude the code
and trim the walkthrough process. I'd suggest that those interested in more detail see the 
full report.
