Here, I give a walkthrough of my submission to [Kaggle's](http://www.kaggle.com) famous 
[Titanic Machine Learning competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). I achieved an 
accuracy of 82% with my random forest algorithm, placing me in the top 3% of teams.
  
Please view my [RPubs document](http://rpubs.com/kafay/Machine-Learning-with-Titanic-R)
for my walkthrough. The raw code is found in a link at the bottom of the RPubs document.
