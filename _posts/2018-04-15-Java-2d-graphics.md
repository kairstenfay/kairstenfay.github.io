After teaching myself programming for the past year and a half, I decided to take the plunge and learn programming in a
more structured way. Namely, I enrolled in UW's [CSE 142](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/18sp/) class,
"Computer Programming I". This course was taught in Java, a new language for my repertoire. In lectures, we spent a week
discussing Java's graphics abilities (who knew they existed!?), and this is the image I designed for a homework assignment.

As we were prohibited from using advanced material, I am particularly proud of how I made the phone icon. It's composed
of two rectangles and two ovals!
