After teaching myself programming for the past year and a half, I decided to take the plunge and learn programming in a more structured way. Namely, by enrolling in UW's [CSE 142](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse142/18sp/) class, "Computer Programming I". This course was taught in Java, which was a language I was previously unfamiliar with. We spent a week discussding Java's graphics abilities (who knew!?), and this is the image I designed for a homework assignment.  
As we were prohibited from using advanced material, I am particularly proud of how I made the phone icon. It's composed two rectangles and two ovals!
