My old lab, where I previously worked under Dr. L. Scott Mills, was featured in Science magazine last month for its extraordinary work regarding tracking the winter coat color of eight mammal and bird species that change coat color from brown to white in the winter in at least some part of their range. I worked on this project for over a year beginning as a volunteer during my undergraduate career. I am delighted to see that our research resonated well with such a high-impact journal.
