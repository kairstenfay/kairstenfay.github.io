I recently decided to try my hand at data viz competitions. I realized that one of my biggest challenges in managing
my time is that I often fall victim to a common criticism of the academia mindset. That is, I often
jump around in my work, thinking "oh, that's an interesting problem!" without finishing the work I had already begun.
While I put a lot of work into producing this walk-through tutorial-style Jupyter Notebook for
visualizing data gathered in a survey posted for [r/travel](http://reddit.com/r/travel) visitors, I think my lack of
clear focus when approaching this challenge held me back. I tried to do too many things and eventually ran out of time
to finish anything with the quality I normally expect of myself. That being said, I hope that anyone who is
new to Seaborn or Matplotlib will find some useful, reusable code that will further their own
data visualization projects. The amount of redundant code found across the plotting functions
is what inspired my latest project, [Seafarer](https://github.com/kairstenfay/seafarer).
