I completed this machine learning project as a final assignment for my Coursera class offered
by professors at Johns Hopkins. For this task, I had to classify bicep curls by the form 
used to perform them: namely, there was the correct form and four incorrect ways to perform
the curl. I used the caret package in R to train 6 models including a decision tree, random 
forest algorithm, and boosting and bagging meta-algorithms. My final report is viewable as 
a compiled HTML file [here](https://kairstenfay.github.io/dataScienceCoursera/).
