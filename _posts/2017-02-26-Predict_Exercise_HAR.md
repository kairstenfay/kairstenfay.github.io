I completed this machine learning project as a final assignment for my Coursera class offered
by professors at Johns Hopkins. For this task, I used the caret package in R to train 6 models
including a decision tree, random forest, and boosting and bagging meta-algorithms. My 
final report is viewable as a compiled HTML file [here](https://kairstenfay.github.io/dataScienceCoursera/).
