Here, I completed an analysis of the crimes that occurred in Seattle during the
summer of 2014. Analysis question included: Which are the most common crimes? What hour of
the day do the most crimes occur? and more.  

The audience for this project was my fellow classmates. This project was meant to be 
extremely thorough and 100% reproducible. In a business setting, I would exclude the code
and trim the walkthrough process. I'd suggest that those interested in more detail see the 
full report.
