title: "R Project: Creating a Tidy Dataset"
date: 2016-09-17
---

For this assignment, I was given a test and train dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository.](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
We specifically used data from the [Samsung Galaxy 3 HAR Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

Please follow this [link](https://github.com/kairstenfay/dataScienceCoursera/tree/master/JHCourse3Week4)
to view my repository which contains a README, a codebook, and the R script solution that I used to 
create my tidy dataset.
