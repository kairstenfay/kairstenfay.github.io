For this assignment from my Reproducible Research class at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), I completed a brief 
analysis of the negative impacts storm events have historically had on US population, property, and crops.


We were given the following National Weather Service data:
- A zipped [CSV of Storm Data](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) 
- A [codebook](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/NWS_Storm_data_documentation.pdf) explaining the variables 
- A [Storm Data FAQ](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/National_Climatic_Data_Center_Storm_Events_FAQ.pdf) page
