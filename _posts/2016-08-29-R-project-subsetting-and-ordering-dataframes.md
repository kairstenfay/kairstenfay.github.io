I recently created some functions in R for an assignment in my R programming MOOC.

The [data](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/outcome-of-care-measures.csv) and [metadata](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/hospital-data.csv) were provided for the assignment.

The [instructions](https://d18ky98rnyall9.cloudfront.net/_775189147d7b89d66333adf6d920b52d_ProgAssignment3v2.pdf?Expires=1472601600&Signature=Ej9oxxKUtqUagj-Rh-Gr52GTxJxWN5ScABHTUksesnxVavAi~~qqPo37JNAkE6PZeHAZhKJwSF1kVpogrEOshIrx9uxoOBc7VNeyNGi1WuTlHmLgJoqZf0vp~MInMBkmmydL7HnWRXAuYJitqcmZcmkB7Cba8UIgcRjYJHLwzbE_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A) specifically mentioned to not call on previous user-defined functions for subsequent problems within the assignment.

Please see my solutions below.

[best.R](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/best.R)

[rankhospital.R](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/rankhospital.R)

[rankall.R](https://github.com/kairstenfay/kairstenfay.github.io/blob/master/_posts/R-projects/rankall.R)

I'd like to thank [DanieleP](https://github.com/DanieleP), whose [tutorial](https://github.com/DanieleP/PA3-tutorial/blob/master/README.md) for this problem gave me a set of functions to build from in order to complete the assignment.
