I recently created some functions in R for an assignment in my R programming MOOC.

The [data]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/outcome-of-care-measures.csv") and [metadata]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/hospita-data.csv") were provided for the assignment.

The [instructions]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/instructions.pdf") specifically mentioned to not call on previous user-defined functions for subsequent problems within the assignment.

Please see my solutions below.

[best.R]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/best.R")
[rankhospital.R]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/rankhospital.R")
[rankall.R]("/2016-08-29-R-project-subsetting-and-ordering-dataframes/rankall.R")
