 I work for the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org) at the University of Washington. In order to improve our internal organization, I was asked to visualize our data sources by country and data type. Please view my publicly available Tableau viz [here](https://nutrition.healthdata.org/data).
