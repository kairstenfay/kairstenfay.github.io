During my tenure at the Mills lab, I gathered and cleaned data on the coat color of 16 mammal and bird species that change coat color from brown in the summer to white in the winter in some part of their range. This research was part of a larger [coat color phenology](http://www.umt.edu/research/millslab/coat.php) study spearheaded by Dr. Mills himself as a way of better understanding the ecological implications of climate change. My final visualization is [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kairsten.fay#!/vizhome/CoatColorPhenology/Dashboard1).
