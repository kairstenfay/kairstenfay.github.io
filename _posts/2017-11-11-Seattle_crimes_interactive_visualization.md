After exploring Seattle crime data last year, I decided to revisit the source of this data set and take a new look at Seattle crimes by neighborhood instead of by time of day or year. The inspiration for this project came from a friend whose parents are relocating to Seattle. He wanted to put his parents in the safest neighborhood possible.
