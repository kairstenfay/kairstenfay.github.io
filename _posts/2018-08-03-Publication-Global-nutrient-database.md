In a joint effort with the UN FAO, the nutrition team at IHME recently published an article on the global availability of micro- and macronutrients from 1980 to 2013 in 195 different contries. Check out the article [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30170-0) along with the [interactive visualization](http://nutrition.healthdata.org/global-nutrient-database) I made for it.
