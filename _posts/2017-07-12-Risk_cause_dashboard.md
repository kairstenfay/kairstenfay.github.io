At [IHME](http://healthdata.org), I was given the task of creating a dashboard template that would allow for easy filtering of Age, Sex, Location, and Year. The goal was that it could be used across multiple risks with little to no manual adjustments necessary. [Here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/kairsten.fay#!/vizhome/risk_cause_template/meidashboard), I visualize overweight prevalence in my dashboard. I added the additional functionality of figure titles that update dynamically depending on the filtered values.
