<p>
	<i>Data scientist, biologist, investor, teacher, and traveler</i>
</p>

<p>
	I am a passionate problem solver and a highly driven self-learner with a logic-forward mind and a desire to know the truth. As a data scientist, I want to help solve many of the worlds biggest problems, from economic growth and development to public health, environmental issues, and more. </p>

<p> 
	I am an independent student studying data science full-time in a DIY-style bootcamp. I use Coursera modules, Kaggle competitions, and other resources to complete projects and learn core concepts.  
</p>
<p>
	One day, I dream of applying my data science skills to ecological research in industry. I studied biology with a concentration in ecology, evolution, and conservation in my undergraduate career. Oddly enough, I worked mostly with bugs across entomology, ecology, and genetics. I worked as both a lab and a field technician, eithering capturing butterflies with nets on an army base, removing mosquitoes' heads to extract dog heartworm parasites, or intoxicating fruit flies with alcohol-laced food. I also enjoy investing money in the stock market, especially in <a href="http://www.morningstar.com/company/sustainability">socially responsible funds</a>. I'm a savvy self-starter and have even dabbled in some small entrepreneurial pursuits, such as running my own pet care business on the side or selling handmade earrings through my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FidelityEarrings">Etsy shop</a>.  
</p>
<p>
	I am self-aware and have previously tutored calculus, chemistry, and English. I am patient, understanding of diverse personality types, and work wonderfully on a team. If you are in the Seattle area, you can hire me, too! Thanks for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy my posts.  
</p>
<p> Sincerely, <br>
