    <p>
    <br>
        Hi, I'm Kairsten (prounced <i>CARE-stin</i>). I work in that delightfully blurry line between software
        engineering and data science. I am passionate about tool building on both the front end and back end. I
        currently work as a full stack web developer at the
        <a href="http://www.healthdata.org">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a>. I previously worked as a
        data analyst on the <a href="http://nutrition.healthdata.org">dietary risk factors</a> team.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a storyteller, a tool builder, and an avid autodidact with a desire to know the truth. In my free time, I am
        constantly learning new languages and libraries, building visualizations, and improving my code readability and
        re-usability. I grew up on the East coast and am currently based in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
        I occasionally do freelance Tableau dashboard development. Please email me at
        <a href="mailto:kairstenfay@gmail.com">kairsten.fay@gmail.com</a> to schedule an informational.
        Thanks for visiting my website.
