<p>
	<i>Data scientist, biologist, investor, teacher, and traveler</i>
</p>

<p>
	I am a passionate problem solver and a highly driven self-learner with a logic-forward mind and a desire to know the truth. As a data scientist, I want to help solve many of the worlds biggest problems, from economic growth and development to public health, environmental issues, and more. </p>

<p> 
	I am studying data science full-time in a DIY-style bootcamp. I use Coursera modules, Kaggle competitions, and other resources to complete projects and learn core concepts.  
</p>
<p>
	I dream of one day applying my data science skills to ecological research in industry. In my undergraduate career, I studied biology with a concentration in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Oddly enough, I worked mostly with bugs across ecology, entomology, and genetics disciplines. I've worked as both a lab and a field technician, either capturing <a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~haddad/">butterflies</a> on an army base, decapitating <a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/entomology/reiskind">mosquitoes</a> to extract dog heartworm parasites, or intoxicating <a href="https://mackay.gnets.ncsu.edu/">fruit flies</a> with alcohol-laced food to measure survival. In my last position with the <a href="https://research.cnr.ncsu.edu/sites/millslab/">Mills lab</a>, I worked on an ad hoc project as a GIS technician creating and filling a database of information on the distribution of coat color of 16 mammal and bird species that molt white during the winter as a camouflage technique. To analyze the data, I found myself using SQL and Python to build queries, which is where my interest in data science began.  
</p>
<p>
	In my free time, I enjoy reading, exercising, exploring Seattle, and investing money in the stock market, especially in <a href="http://www.morningstar.com/company/sustainability">socially responsible</a> funds. I'm a savvy self-starter and have even dabbled in some entrepreneurial pursuits, such as running my own pet care business on the side or selling handmade earrings through my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FidelityEarrings">Etsy shop</a>.  
</p>
<p>
	I have previously tutored calculus, chemistry, and English, leading me to be self-aware as a teacher and patient and understanding of diverse personality types. I enjoy working both independently and on a team. If your company is located in the Seattle area, you can hire me, too! Thanks for visiting my website. Be sure to check out my <a href="/blog">blog posts</a>, too.

<p> Sincerely, <br>
