<h2>About Me</h2>
<dif class="blurb"></dif>


<p>
	I am a storyteller, a tool builder, and an avid autodidact with a desire to know the truth. In my free time, I am constantly learning new languages and libraries, building visualizations, and improving my code readability and reusability. I grew up on the East coast and am currently based in Seattle.
