<p>
	I am a storyteller, a tool builder, and an avid autodidact with a desire to know the truth. In my free time, I am constantly learning new languages and libraries, building visualizations, and improving my code readability and reusability. Most of my job experience has been in academic settings. I grew up on the East coast and am currently based in Seattle. 
</p>
<p>
    I code primarily in Python, but I have completed projects using Java, R, SQL, and JavaScript, too. My current preferred method for visualizing static graphs is Seaborn (Python) or GGPlot (R). For dynamic or interactive visualizations, I enjoy using Tableau or Superset. I'm actively learning D3 to handle all of the low-level customizations that my current methods don't provide for me.

<p> Thanks for visiting my website.
