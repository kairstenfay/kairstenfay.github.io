<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Kairsten (<em>CARE-stin</em>). I'm a full stack developer with a passion for data visualization and
        UX design. I currently work at <a href="http://fredhutch.org">Fred Hutch</a> in the
        <a href="http://bedford.io">Bedford Lab</a> as a contributor to both <a href="http://nextstrain.org">Nextstrain</a>
        and the <a href="http://seattleflu.org">Seattle Flu Study</a>.
        I previously worked at <a href="http://www.healthdata.org">IHME</a> as a full stack developer and a
        data analyst on the <a href="http://nutrition.healthdata.org">dietary risk factors</a> team.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am an autodidact who used free and online resources to learn to code after receiving a Bachelor's degree in Biology.
        When I'm not programming, I enjoy cooking, playing tabletop games, weightlifting, climbing, and reading sci-fi or fantasy.
        I grew up on the East coast and am currently based in Seattle.

        I occasionally do freelance Tableau dashboard development. Please email me at
