    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    <br>
        Hi, I'm Kairsten (prounced <i>CARE-stin</i>). I work in that delightfully blurry line between software engineering and data science. I am
        passionate about tool building on both the front end and back end. I currently work as a data analyst at the
        <a href="http://www.healthdata.org">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> on the
        <a href="http://nutrition.healthdata.org">dietary risk factors</a> team.
        <p>
        I am a storyteller, a tool builder, and an avid autodidact with a desire to know the truth. In my free time, I am
        constantly learning new languages and libraries, building visualizations, and improving my code readability and
        reusability. Most of my job experience has been in academic settings. I grew up on the East coast and am currently
        based in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
        I code primarily in Python, but I have completed projects using Java, R, SQL, and JavaScript, too. My current
        preferred method for visualizing static graphs is Seaborn (Python) or GGPlot (R). For dynamic or interactive
        visualizations, I enjoy using Tableau or Superset. I'm actively learning D3 to handle all of the low-level
        customizations that my current methods don't provide for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        I occasionally do freelance Tableau dashboard development. Please email me at
        <a href="mailto:kairstenfay@gmail.com">kairsten.fay@gmail.com</a> to schedule an informational.
        Thanks for visiting my website.
    </p>
