<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I received my Bachelor's degree in 2015 in Biology with a concentration in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation. For over a year now, I have been working on a GIS project that analyzes the coat-color phenology (i.e. global timing) of 20 mammal and bird species that change coat color from brown to white in the winter. 
This experience led me to develop skills in Python and R. I realized that, although cleaning up data may be tedious at times, I thoroughly enjoyed using programming and statistics skills to visualize data and answer unsolved questions. I am now actively pursuing a career in data science or a closely related field such as data analytics.

<h5>Interests</h5>
<p>My interests are far and wide-ranging, but the most important to me are cultural diversity, servant-leadership, and outdoor activities. 
<b>Servant-leadership<br></b>
Service is a core value of mine, which I have demonstrated through various volunteer experiences. I spent two of my college spring breaks going to Nicaragua and Mexico to serve the communities there. During my study abroad, I also volunteered for two months teaching English at a local academy.

<br>
<b>[<small>Fall 2011 – Present</small>]&nbsp; Urban Ministries of Wake County<br></b>
I have volunteered with the Urban Ministries in many ways. I primarily served as an eligibility interviewer where I would process clinic applications in either English or Spanish. I volunteered in the food pantry, organized a food drive in three days that raised over 800 pounds of food, and am currently helping organize and advertise a major fundraising event, Tour D’Coop.
<br><br><b>Culture<br></b>
I am passionate about Hispanic culture. I learned Spanish in two years for my enrichment. My favorite hobby is salsa dancing. I deejayed Hispanic radio on my own specialty show on 88.1 WKNC FM for one year. I studied tropical and Galápagos biota for four months in Ecuador.  I also enjoy Hispanic films, literature, and food.
