<h2>About Me</h2>
<dif class="blurb"></dif>
<p>
	Data scientist, biologist, investor, teacher, and traveler 
</p>
<p>
	I am a passionate problem solver and a highly driven self-learner with a logic-forward mind and a desire to know the truth. I want to become a data scientist because I believe it is the best way to solve many of the worlds biggest problems, from economic growth and development to public health, environmental issues, and more. </p>

<p> 
	I am an independent student enrolled in several Coursera MOOCs. I also utilize other interactive programming tutorials such as Codecademy to acquire the skills I know and I hope I'll need as a data scientist.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I am in the final stages of a project I helped design as a research technician at NC State University. I look forward to sharing the code I used to query the data set to improve the visualizations I created for the data in ArcGIS. 
</p>
<p>
	Stay tuned for more to come in the following weeks and months!
</p>
<p> Yours truly, <br>
	Kairsten Fay
