<p>
	<i>Data scientist, biologist, investor, teacher, and traveler</i>
</p>

<p>
	I am a passionate problem solver and self-learner with a logic-forward mind and a desire to know the truth. As a data scientist, I want to help solve many of the worlds biggest problems, from economic growth and development to public health, environmental issues, and more. </p>

<p> 
	I have arrived at this point in my career largely through studying full-time in a DIY-style bootcamp. I use Coursera modules, Kaggle competitions, and other open-source, online resources. In five years, I see myself working in private ecological research, diving once again into the field I studied as an undergraduate with my newly acquired skills. 
</p>
<p>
	In my free time, I enjoy social dancing, cooking, reading, and investing money in the stock market, especially in <a href="http://www.morningstar.com/company/sustainability">socially responsible</a> funds. I'm a savvy self-starter and have even dabbled in some entrepreneurial pursuits, such as running my own pet care business on the side or selling handmade earrings through my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/FidelityEarrings">Etsy shop</a>.  
</p>

<p> Thanks for visiting my website.
