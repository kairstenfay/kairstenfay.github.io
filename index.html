<p>
Hello! My name is Kairsten Fay. I am a senior studying Biology at North Carolina State University. I graduate May 9th, 2015. 
I am seeking a full time job using GIS and data analysis to contribute to conservation efforts in the field and on the policy level.
This website contains information on me, some of my projects, awards and certificates, as well as my contact information. My CV is at the bottom of the page. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p>
I am interested in analyzing large data sets to find trends and solutions to conservation issues. I enjoy using ArcGIS to approach patterns across landscapes. In my free time recently, I have been teaching myself to code. I created this website using nothing but a basic frame, my existing knowledge of HTML and all the CSS tutorial resources available to me online. I am currently taking a course from CodeAcademy on coding in JavaScript. Furthermore, upon graduation, I will enroll in a course on computing in R on Coursera.

<h5>
PERSONAL STATEMENT</h5>
<p>
I am a senior biology student graduating from North Carolina State University. I have laboratory and field skills essential for understanding research methods. I am looking for a laboratory technician or PhD position in quantitative or computation ecology, especially regarding climate change where I can use GIS, R, and/or other data analysis or programming skills. My background in ecology and conservation as well as quantitative genetics prepares me for such a position.
